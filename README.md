# EE579 Final Project "What's Playing?" ReadMe File ### By: Ameya Pethkar, Himanshu Gupta and Omkar Chavan ##<p>This is a work in progress for Final Project of EE579 course at USC. In this project we are trying to make a distributed kind of music application. This involves having an Android application "What's Playing?" running on Android Mobile devices and communicating with a centralized server as well as with other mobile phones. </p><p> So far in the Android application we have designed and implemented the GUI along with a first screen showing options such as One-time registration, Option to login the server i.e. go online and working offline in Invisible mode. In all these options the Multi-threaded server maintains list of Registered users and LoginDetails in separate text files respectively.Further we have a second screen with different features which are as follos:<ul><li>Friends Online : Finds Online Friends</li><li>My favorites : A user’s favorites</li><li>Request a file : Looks for friends who has a particular file the user wants</li><li>Search Online: Look for that particular file online on the internet</li><li>My Activity : History of previous activities</li><li>Upload to Server : Create your own database@centralized server</li><li>Add Friends : Add People to your Friend Network (My Gang)</li><li>Log off : Logoff from the Server</li></ul></p><p>Then we have a Multi-Threaded Server waiting for incoming connections from the Clients(Phones) and based on the nature of information from Client (say Register, Login, ShowOnlineFriends, ShowAllOnlineFriends etc.) the server performs corresponding action. </p><p> <ul>Work in Progress:<li> Translating Server and Client codes on Android devices to communicate with each other </li><li> Deciding on the packet format for file transfer </li><li> Actual File Request and File Transfer </li><li> Optimizing code and complete testing of the final configuration </li></ul></p><p> Kindly note that this is a work in progress and it is likely to contains bugs or may be unoptimized hence any valuable suggestions, comments would be appreciated.
